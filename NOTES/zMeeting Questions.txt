Questions For Meeting:

Referencing code, for base algorithms, such as Dijkstra, Mergesort etc do I need to reference them? What's the rules on plagarism regarding this.

What I've Done:

- I've opted to use SUMO as it is widely used, up-to-date, big support base, and I believe there exists some data that contains live traffic data from real roads which could be great.
- I've implemented static search algorithms


To Do:
- Implement Dynamic search algorithms interfacing with sumo for TraCI for python
- I think I'm going to use a heuristic search algorithm, where the costs of travelling an edge between two nodes will depend on traffic, junctions, etc. 
- I understand how I can adjust costs, I'm unsure on how to predict time spent at junctions using any form of learning methods, I keep thinking to myself why don't I just write an algorithm to take current data
