SUMO Emissions:

SUMO Emissions generates it's data for a given range of velocities, accelerations and slopes, given the vehicle's emission class.

SUMO is able to do this as it has data for each vehicle during run-time that in a real-world situation, would not be available.

In a real-world situation, we would have data for one vehicle, the one trying to avoid the pollution.
We will have the mean speed of that vehicle.



So using SUMO Emissions data, I can get the emission values over the entire edge
at a specific step interval, I will sum over all step intervals as that is the
amount of pollution that the user will be exposed to travelling along that edge.

I will also sum over the speed and divide by the number of steps to get the mean
speed of the vehicle throughout the edge.

During the training of the NN, the mean speed will be calculated from data gathered
during and after the simulation.
During the test simulation, the mean speed of the vehicle will be calculated by
estimated travel time and distance of the edge.
